- Real-time data plotting and logging with CSV/JSON export
- Automatic COM port scanning and device identification
- Support for multiple Rigol DP711 devices simultaneously
- Thread-safe measurement workers for continuous data acquisition

## Essential Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Main multi-instrument GUI (recommended entry point)
python main.py

# Single Keithley GUI (legacy)
python gui_main.py

# Run tests
python test_keithley.py

# Quick system test (import verification)
python -c "from gui_multi_instrument import main; print('âœ… System ready')"
```

### Development Commands
The system uses PyQt6 for GUI and requires PyVISA for Keithley and PySerial for Rigol. The main application automatically checks for missing dependencies and provides helpful error messages.

**Key Dependencies:**
- PyQt6 6.5.2: GUI framework
- PyVISA 1.13.0: Keithley instrument communication
- PySerial 3.5: Rigol serial communication
- pyqtgraph 0.13.3: Real-time plotting
- numpy, pandas, scipy: Data processing

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Pattern
The codebase follows an object-oriented design with abstract base classes for instrument control:

- **InstrumentBase**: Abstract base class defining common instrument interface
- **PowerSupplyBase**: Extends InstrumentBase for power supply specific functionality  
- **SourceMeterBase**: Extends PowerSupplyBase for source meter capabilities
- **InstrumentManager**: Manages multiple instruments in a unified interface

### Multi-Device Architecture
The system supports multiple devices of the same type simultaneously:

- **PortManager**: Automatic COM port detection and device identification via SCPI *IDN? queries
- **Device Widgets**: Modular widget system supporting both single and multi-device modes with integrated device management
- **Thread-Safe Operation**: All device operations are thread-safe with proper resource management
- **UnifiedWorkerBase**: Standardized threading system with state management and resource cleanup

### Key Components

### Instrument Communication
- **Keithley 2461**: TCP/IP connection on port 5025, supports both PyVISA and raw socket
  - Default connection method: PyVISA (recommended)
  - Fallback to raw socket if PyVISA unavailable
  - Standard SCPI command set with instrument-specific extensions
- **Rigol DP711**: RS232 serial connection (COM ports), supports multiple simultaneous devices
  - Automatic port detection and device identification via SCPI *IDN? command
  - Smart port filtering to avoid conflicts with already connected devices
  - Default baudrate: 9600, configurable in widget
  - Requires female-female cable despite male connector on device
- All instruments use SCPI command protocol with consistent error handling and timeout management

### Data Management
- Sessions-based data logging with automatic timestamping
- Export formats: CSV and JSON
- Real-time data visualization with configurable point limits (default 1000 points)
- Automatic log file rotation (10MB files, 5 backups retained)

### Theme System
The GUI automatically detects and applies system themes:
- **Detection**: Works across macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Application**: Single detection at startup (no runtime switching to avoid UI issues)
- **Fallback**: Uses Qt palette detection if OS-specific methods fail

## Important Implementation Details

### GUI Threading Model
- Main UI thread handles interface updates
- Unified worker system with `UnifiedWorkerBase` for standardized threading
- `MeasurementWorker` with strategy pattern supporting continuous and sweep measurements
- `ConnectionWorker` for non-blocking instrument connections
- `PortManager` scans for device changes every 2000ms
- Qt signals/slots used for thread-safe communication
- Proper cleanup on application exit to prevent resource leaks
- Background threads automatically terminate when main window closes
- Worker state management with start/stop/pause capabilities

### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive exception handling at instrument communication level
- GUI displays user-friendly error messages while logging technical details
- Automatic resource cleanup using context managers where possible
- Graceful degradation when instruments are disconnected

### SCPI Command Implementation
Both instrument classes follow consistent patterns:
- Connection validation before command execution
- Command/query methods with timeout handling
- Automatic device initialization on connection
- Standard SCPI compliance with instrument-specific extensions

## File Structure Context

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Modern Architecture Features
The codebase has been extensively refactored with a unified architecture system:

**Worker System (`src/workers/`):**
- `UnifiedWorkerBase`: Solves metaclass conflicts, provides standardized threading interface
- `MeasurementWorker`: Strategy pattern supporting continuous measurements and voltage sweeps
- `ConnectionWorker`: Non-blocking connection management with timeout handling
- Worker state management (idle/running/stopping) with proper cleanup

**Data System (`src/data/`):**
- `UnifiedDataManager`: Centralized data handling with multiple storage backends
- `ExportManager`: Multi-format export (CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet) with metadata
- `StorageBackends`: Pluggable storage system (CSV, JSON, SQLite)
- `BufferManager`: Circular buffer management for real-time data

**Configuration System (`src/config/`):**
- Centralized configuration management with validation
- Default settings with per-device customization
- Environment-specific configuration support

### Code Architecture Decisions
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, single purpose
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used in workers for different measurement modes
- **Dependency Injection**: Instruments passed to widgets, not created within them
- **Observer Pattern**: Extensive use of Qt signals for loose coupling
- **Resource Management**: Context managers and proper cleanup in all connection classes
- **Mixin Architecture**: Shared functionality through composable mixins

- `MultiDeviceManager` for multiple devices of same type (multiple DP711s)
- Tabbed interface allows easy switching between instrument types

### GUI Customization
The theme system provides comprehensive styling for both light and dark modes. Custom styles should be added to `ThemeStyleSheet` class methods rather than inline CSS.

### Data Export
The `DataLogger` supports both real-time data streaming and batch export. Session management allows for organized data collection with metadata preservation.

### Port Management
The `PortManager` class provides:
- Real-time port monitoring with change detection
- Device identification using SCPI *IDN? queries
- Smart filtering of available vs. connected ports
- Cross-platform COM port enumeration
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected devices
- Thread-safe port access with locking mechanisms

### Testing Approach
The system includes functional testing capabilities integrated into the main modules. Key testing features:
- Instrument connection validation and communication testing
- SCPI command execution and response parsing verification
- Data logging and export functionality validation
- Real-time error handling and recovery testing

**Testing Notes:**
- Tests require actual hardware or mock instruments for full validation
- Network tests assume Keithley 2461 available at default IP (192.168.0.100)
- Serial tests require available COM ports for Rigol devices
- Use the system's built-in diagnostic features for component testing
- Each widget includes connection testing and validation routines
